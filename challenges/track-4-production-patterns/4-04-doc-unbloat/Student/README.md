# Challenge 4-04: Documentation Unbloat

**Track:** Production Patterns (Advanced 🟣)
**Estimated time:** 30 minutes
**Tier:** Bonus

---

## Background

Every project accumulates doc debt: verbose intros, duplicate sections, outdated warnings, nested caveats-of-caveats. The Documentation Unbloat workflow finds this bloat and opens focused PRs that trim it — no rewrites, just surgical simplification.

The production version in `githubnext/agentics` achieved an **85% merge rate** — 88 merged PRs out of 103 proposed. Maintainers love it because each PR is small, targeted, and easy to review.

Source: `githubnext/agentics/workflows/unbloat-docs.md`

## What It Does

- Targets specific documentation files for simplification review
- Identifies: redundancy, excessive hedging, outdated warnings, over-long examples
- Opens focused PRs with verbosity removed and clarity improved
- Each PR is intentionally small (one file, one concern)

## What You'll Do

1. **Install gh aw** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Pull the production workflow**:
   ```bash
   gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/unbloat-docs.md
   ```

3. **Identify a bloated doc** in your repo — README.md, a long CONTRIBUTING.md, or any doc with "Note:", "Warning:", "Important:" every third paragraph.

4. **Customise** the workflow to target that file and define your project's simplification rules.

5. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   gh aw compile .github/workflows/unbloat-docs.md
   ```

6. **Dry-run** against your bloated doc:
   ```bash
   gh aw run --dry-run .github/workflows/unbloat-docs.md
   ```

7. Review the proposed PR diff — does it match what you'd have cut manually?

## Customize It

- Set the target file explicitly in the body: _"Review `docs/getting-started.md` only"_ — single-file focus produces better diffs
- Define what "simplify" means for your project: _"Remove duplicate notes, shorten examples to the minimum that demonstrates the point, delete any section that duplicates the README"_
- Add PR label `docs-unbloat` so these PRs are filterable
- Adjust the schedule or make it `workflow_dispatch` only if you want manual control

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `.github/workflows/unbloat-docs.md` exists with valid gh-aw frontmatter
- [ ] Target document is explicitly named in the workflow body
- [ ] `safe-outputs: create-pr` is declared
- [ ] Simplification criteria are specific, not vague ("make it shorter" is too vague — "remove duplicate warnings and shorten code examples to one line" is good)
- [ ] `.github/workflows/unbloat-docs.lock.yml` compiles without errors
- [ ] Dry-run proposes at least one real simplification
- [ ] Proposed PR diff is focused (one file, clean changes)

<summary>💡 Hints</summary>

**"The agent keeps removing content I actually want"**
→ Add a preservation rule to the body: _"Do not remove: examples, API references, or any section starting with `## Quick Start`."_

**"How is Unbloat different from Doc Updater?"**
→ Doc Updater fixes accuracy (code changed, docs didn't). Unbloat fixes verbosity (doc was always too long). They compose well — run Updater first, then Unbloat.

**"My docs don't have obvious bloat"**
→ Look for: sentences starting with "Note that", "Please be aware", "It is important to". These almost always can be cut or rewritten more directly.

**"The PR is huge — 50 files changed"**
→ The production workflow targets one or two files per run. Narrow your scope in the body, and use `create-pr` with a focused branch name.

**"Should I run this on a schedule or manually?"**
→ Start with `workflow_dispatch` so you control when it runs. Graduate to a weekly cron once you trust the output.
