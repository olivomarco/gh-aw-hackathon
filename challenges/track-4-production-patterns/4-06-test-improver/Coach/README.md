# Coach Guide: Challenge 4-06 — The Test Improver

---

## What This Challenge Teaches

The consumer side of the causal chain pattern — a workflow that translates analysis (issues from Testify) into implementation (PRs with new tests). Participants learn incremental, focused automation: one PR per file, one concern per PR, human review before merge. They also practice framework-specific prompt engineering.

# Daily Test Improver

You are improving test coverage for a Node.js project using Jest.

First, check for open issues labelled `test-improvement`. If any exist, implement the test described in the top-priority issue. Close the issue in the PR body with "Closes #<issue-number>".

If no labelled issues exist, scan `src/` for exported functions with no corresponding test in `tests/`. Find the most critical untested function (core business logic over utilities).

Write the missing test(s) for that function:
- Use Jest syntax: `describe`, `it`, `expect`
- Test the happy path, at least one error path, and one edge case
- Keep the new test file focused — no more than 50 lines

Open a single PR with the new or updated test file. Do not modify source code.
```

## Common Blockers

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Generated tests don't run (syntax errors) | Specify the framework version: "Use Jest 29 syntax" and check generated output before committing |
| PR modifies source code, not just tests | Add constraint: "Do not modify any file in `src/`. Only add or modify files in `tests/`" |
| Can't find the causal chain connection | Walk them through: Testify creates issue with label → Improver reads issues with that label → Improver opens PR and closes the issue |
| Test file tests the wrong thing | Enforce structure: "Each test must assert a specific return value, not just that the function runs without error" |
| Opens 10 PRs at once | Add limit: "Open at most one PR per run" |

## How to Verify It's Working

1. Have a `test-improvement` issue open from Challenge 4-05 (or create one manually)
2. Trigger `workflow_dispatch`
3. Confirm a PR opens that addresses the specific issue
4. Check the PR — does it close the issue in the PR body?
5. Review the test — is it syntactically valid? Does it test what the issue described?

## Coaching Notes

The most revealing moment in this challenge is when participants look at a Testify issue and then look at the Improver PR — and see the chain working end to end. Prompt them to articulate what would break if the issues weren't specific enough (_the Improver would produce vague tests_).

The framework-specificity lesson is practical: a prompt that says "write tests" produces worse output than "write Jest 29 tests using `describe`/`it` with async `await` patterns and `.resolves`/`.rejects` matchers." Have them find the right level of specificity for their own framework.

Fast squads: connect both 4-05 and 4-06 and run the full chain — Testify at 9am, Improver at 10am. Watch one pipeline create and resolve its own test debt.
