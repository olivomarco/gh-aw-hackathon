# Challenge 4-05: The Uber Expert (Daily Testify)

**Track:** Production Patterns (Advanced 🟣)
**Estimated time:** 30 minutes
**Tier:** Bonus

---

## Background

Most workflows are generalists. Daily Testify is a specialist: a workflow with deep testing expertise baked directly into its prompt, running every day to scrutinise your test suite and create issues for concrete improvement opportunities.

In `github/gh-aw`, this pattern produced 19 issues, 13 of which led to merged PRs — a **100% causal chain merge rate**. Every issue that got acted on resulted in merged code. This is the *producer* half of a causal chain: it creates the issues; the Test Improver (4-06) acts on them.

Source: `github/gh-aw/.github/workflows/daily-testify-uber-super-expert.md`

## What It Does

- Runs daily on a cron schedule
- Analyses your test suite with embedded domain expertise (test quality, coverage gaps, anti-patterns)
- Creates issues for specific, actionable improvements — not vague suggestions
- Uses `create-issue` only (no PRs) — keeps the signal clean and human-reviewed before action

## What You'll Do

1. **Install gh aw** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Pull the production workflow**:
   ```bash
   gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/daily-testify-uber-super-expert.md
   ```

3. **Read the prompt body carefully** — notice how the "uber expert" persona is established. This is the key technique: writing a rich, opinionated system prompt inside the workflow body.

4. **Customise** the expertise to match your test framework and language.

5. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   gh aw compile .github/workflows/daily-testify-uber-super-expert.md
   ```

6. **Trigger manually** and examine the first issue it creates — is it actionable?

## Customize It

- Replace the test framework reference with yours: jest, pytest, rspec, vitest, go test, etc.
- Add repo-specific context to the expert persona: _"This repo uses integration tests extensively; unit test coverage below service boundaries is low"_
- Adjust what counts as "an improvement worth raising": _"Only create an issue if it covers: a missing edge case, an untested error path, or a test that passes for the wrong reason"_
- Set the issue template: label `testing`, assign to a test owner, add to a project board

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `.github/workflows/daily-testify-uber-super-expert.md` exists with valid frontmatter
- [ ] `schedule: cron` trigger is set
- [ ] Expert persona is established in the body (specific, not generic)
- [ ] `safe-outputs: create-issue` is declared — **no** `create-pr` here
- [ ] `.lock.yml` compiles without errors
- [ ] Manually triggered run creates at least one actionable issue
- [ ] Issue body is specific: names a file, a function, or a concrete gap — not "add more tests"

<summary>💡 Hints</summary>

**"What makes a good 'uber expert' persona?"**
→ Specificity. Don't write "you are a testing expert". Write: "You are an expert in Node.js testing with Jest. You know that `describe` nesting beyond 3 levels is a smell, that `expect.assertions(n)` prevents silent passes in async tests, and that snapshot tests without meaningful expectations are noise."

**"The issues it creates are too vague"**
→ Add an output constraint: _"Each issue must name: 1) the file, 2) the function or test, 3) exactly what is missing or wrong, 4) a one-sentence fix suggestion."_

**"How does this connect to Test Improver (4-06)?"**
→ Test Improver watches for issues with a specific label (e.g., `test-improvement`) and turns them into PRs. Label your Testify issues consistently so the chain connects.

**"I don't have many tests yet"**
→ That's fine — the agent will tell you _where_ tests are missing, which is useful signal even before the Test Improver acts.

**"Should I use create-pr instead?"**
→ No. This is an intentional design: human review between analysis and action. The 100% merge rate comes from that review gate, not from skipping it.
