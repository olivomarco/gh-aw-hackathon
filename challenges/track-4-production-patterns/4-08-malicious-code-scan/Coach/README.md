# Coach Guide: Challenge 4-08 — Malicious Code Scan

---

## What This Challenge Teaches

Supply-chain threat modelling expressed as an agentic workflow. Participants learn to define threat patterns precisely (not just "look for bad code"), scope reviews to recent changes (not the entire codebase), and structure alerts with enough context for a security reviewer to act immediately. This is the most security-engineering-adjacent challenge in Track 4.

# Daily Malicious Code Scan

Review all commits merged into `main` in the last 7 days.

Flag any of the following patterns added or modified in that window:

1. **Obfuscated evaluation**: `eval()`, `Function()`, or `new Function()` with non-literal string arguments; base64/hex decoded strings passed to execution functions
2. **Unexpected network calls**: `fetch`, `http.request`, `axios`, or `curl` calls to external domains not present in the repo before this week
3. **Credential access patterns**: reading `process.env` or `os.environ` for keys containing TOKEN, SECRET, KEY, PASSWORD, or PRIVATE
4. **Dynamic imports**: `require(variable)` or `import(expression)` where the module path is constructed at runtime
5. **Workflow self-modification**: changes to `.github/workflows/` files that were not part of a reviewed PR

For each flagged pattern:
- Note the file path, line number, and commit SHA
- Explain why it was flagged (which pattern, what the code does)
- Assess likelihood: is this likely benign (e.g., test utilities) or suspicious?

Open a single issue titled "🔍 Malicious Code Scan — [date]" only if high-likelihood suspicious patterns are found. If all findings are likely benign, add a brief comment to the most recent scan issue instead.

If nothing suspicious is found, do nothing.
```

## Common Blockers

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too many false positives | Add a likelihood assessment step: "Mark each finding as likely benign / uncertain / suspicious before deciding to open an issue" |
| Agent scans the entire repo history | Scope explicitly: "Only review commits from the last 7 days" |
| Can't test without real suspicious code | Have participant add a test trigger: `// SCAN-TEST: eval(atob('dGVzdA=='))` in a comment — remove after test |
| "No suspicious patterns found" even with test trigger | Check if the agent is actually reading the recent commits — may need to explicitly point at commit diff tool |
| Alert issue doesn't have enough context | Enforce structure: "Each finding must include: file, line number, commit SHA, and one sentence explaining the risk" |

---

## How to Verify It's Working

1. Add a clearly fake test pattern to a file (e.g., a comment with `eval(atob(...))`) and commit to a branch, then merge
2. Trigger `workflow_dispatch`
3. Confirm an issue opens referencing the specific file and line number
4. Verify the issue explains why it was flagged (not just "found eval")
5. Remove the test pattern, commit, trigger again — confirm no issue opens

## Coaching Notes

The most important framing: this is a _defence layer_, not a replacement for code review. Socratic prompt: _"A CodeQL rule can detect known patterns. What can this agent detect that CodeQL can't?"_ Answer: novel patterns, contextual intent, cross-file reasoning, and things that "look wrong" in context even without a CVE.

The "likely benign vs suspicious" classification step is critical for reducing alert fatigue. Without it, every eval in a test file generates noise. Ask participants: _"If this fires every day with 50 findings, what happens to the team's trust in the tool?"_ Then have them add the likelihood gate.

Participants with security backgrounds often want to add more patterns. Encourage it — but cap at 5-7 patterns per run to keep the prompt focused and the output actionable.
