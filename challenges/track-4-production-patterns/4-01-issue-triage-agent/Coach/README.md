# Coach Guide: Challenge 4-01 — Issue Triage Agent

---

## What This Challenge Teaches

The fundamentals of production agentic workflows: event-driven triggering on `issues`, constrained tool access via `toolsets`, and safe-outputs that prevent unintended side effects. This is the pattern every other production workflow builds on — participants leave understanding why allowlists matter and how to prevent label hallucination.

## Expected Solution Shape

```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened]

permissions:
  issues: write

safe-outputs:
  add-labels: {}
  add-comment: {}

tools:
  github:
    toolsets: [issues, labels]

engines:
  - copilot

# Issue Triage Agent

Read the issue title and body. Using only labels from this list: [bug, enhancement, docs, question, good first issue], apply 1-3 labels that best describe the issue.

After labelling, post a brief comment explaining the categorisation in one sentence.

Do not create new labels. If no label fits clearly, apply `question` and note the ambiguity in the comment.
```

The key elements: explicit allowlist in the body, `add-labels` + `add-comment` in safe-outputs, `toolsets: [issues, labels]` for label lookup.

## Common Blockers

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Agent creates labels that don't exist | Add explicit allowlist to body: "Only use labels from: [...]" |
| Labels applied but no comment appears | Check `add-comment` is in `safe-outputs`, not just `add-labels` |
| "Insufficient permissions" in run log | Needs `issues: write` in permissions block |
| Workflow doesn't fire on existing issues | `reopened` covers re-triaging; `opened` only fires on new issues |
| Agent applies 5+ labels to every issue | Add constraint: "Apply 1-3 labels maximum" |

---

## How to Verify It's Working

1. Open a new issue with a clear topic (e.g., "Button not working on mobile" → should get `bug`)
2. Check the Actions tab — confirm the workflow ran
3. Verify the issue now has labels AND a comment
4. Open an issue that's ambiguous — confirm the agent handles it gracefully (applies `question`, explains why)
5. Confirm no invented labels appear

## Coaching Notes

The most common failure mode is label hallucination — the agent invents labels that sound reasonable but don't exist in the repo. Socratic prompt: _"What happens if the model suggests a label your repo doesn't have? How would you prevent that?"_ Lead them to the allowlist solution themselves.

The `toolsets: [issues, labels]` is the technical answer; the allowlist in the body is the safety net. Both are needed.
