# Challenge 4-03: Daily Documentation Updater

**Track:** Production Patterns (Advanced 🟣)
**Estimated time:** 30 minutes
**Tier:** Bonus

---

## Background

Code evolves. Docs don't — not unless someone makes them a first-class concern. The Daily Documentation Updater runs on a cron schedule, reviews your docs directory against the actual codebase, and opens PRs for content that has drifted out of sync.

The production version in `githubnext/agentics` achieved a **96% merge rate** — 57 merged PRs out of 59 proposed. When the agent proposes a doc fix, maintainers almost always agree with it.

Source: `githubnext/agentics/workflows/daily-doc-updater.md`

## What It Does

- Triggers on a daily `schedule: cron`
- Scans a configured docs directory (e.g., `docs/`, `README.md`)
- Identifies content that contradicts or no longer matches the codebase
- Opens PRs with targeted, reviewable corrections

## What You'll Do

1. **Install gh aw** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install-gh-aw.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Pull the production workflow**:
   ```bash
   gh aw add-wizard https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/workflows/daily-doc-updater.md
   ```

3. **Read the cron expression** in the frontmatter — understand how `schedule: - cron: "0 9 * * *"` works and what time it fires in UTC.

4. **Customise** the docs scope and review depth for your repository.

5. **Compile**:
   ```bash
   gh aw compile .github/workflows/daily-doc-updater.md
   ```

6. **Dry-run** to see what it would propose:
   ```bash
   gh aw run --dry-run .github/workflows/daily-doc-updater.md
   ```

7. Commit both workflow and `.lock.yml`. Add a stale doc to trigger your first real PR.

## Customize It

- Change the target path in the prompt body: point at `docs/`, `README.md`, or a subdirectory specific to your project
- Adjust the cron schedule — `0 9 * * 1-5` for weekdays only, or `0 9 * * 1` for Monday morning only
- Tune the review depth: "only check API endpoint docs" vs "review all docs for accuracy"
- Add a PR template or label to the `create-pr` output so doc-update PRs are easy to filter

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `.github/workflows/daily-doc-updater.md` exists with valid gh-aw frontmatter
- [ ] Trigger is `schedule: cron` (valid cron expression)
- [ ] Target doc directory is configured to something real in your repo
- [ ] `safe-outputs: create-pr` is declared
- [ ] `.github/workflows/daily-doc-updater.lock.yml` compiles without errors
- [ ] Dry-run produces at least one proposed doc change
- [ ] A manually triggered run opens a real PR with a focused, accurate diff

<summary>💡 Hints</summary>

**"How do I trigger a scheduled workflow manually for testing?"**
→ Add `workflow_dispatch: {}` to your `on:` block. Then trigger it from the Actions tab with "Run workflow".

**"The PR diff is too large / changes too many files"**
→ Constrain the body: _"Review only `docs/api.md`. Open a single PR per file. Each PR should change no more than 10 lines."_ Smaller PRs get merged faster.

**"How do I make sure it doesn't overwrite things it shouldn't?"**
→ `safe-outputs: create-pr` still requires a human to merge. The agent can propose; humans approve.

**"What cron syntax do I use?"**
→ GitHub Actions uses UTC. `0 9 * * *` = 9am UTC daily. Use https://crontab.guru to validate your expression.

**"The agent keeps proposing the same change every day"**
→ The PR merging is the fix. Once merged, the drift disappears. Add a check in the prompt: _"Do not open a PR if an identical open PR already exists."_
