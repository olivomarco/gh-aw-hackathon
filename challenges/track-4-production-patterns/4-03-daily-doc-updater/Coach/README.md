# Coach Guide: Challenge 4-03 — Daily Documentation Updater

---

## What This Challenge Teaches

Scheduled automation with `create-pr` safe-output. Participants learn to think about docs as a living artefact that drifts from code, how to write prompts that detect drift (not just "review docs"), and how to produce focused, mergeable PRs rather than wholesale rewrites.

---

## Expected Solution Shape

```markdown
---
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch: {}

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

safe-outputs:
  create-pr: {}

engines:
  - copilot

# Daily Documentation Updater

Review the documentation in `docs/` against the current codebase.

Focus on:
- API endpoints documented in `docs/api.md` that no longer match `src/routes/`
- Configuration options listed in `docs/config.md` that don't exist in `src/config.ts`
- Code examples that reference deprecated function signatures

For each piece of outdated content found, open a separate PR with the correction.
Keep each PR to a single file change. Write accurate, minimal diffs — do not rewrite sections that are still correct.

If no drift is found, do nothing.
```

The key elements: `workflow_dispatch` alongside cron (for testing), `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write`, a focused doc scope, and explicit "if nothing found, do nothing."

## Common Blockers

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Can't trigger manually | Add `workflow_dispatch: {}` to `on:` block |
| PR contains changes to 20+ files | Constrain scope in body: "Review only `docs/api.md`" |
| Agent keeps proposing the same PR every day | Add: "Do not open a PR if an open PR for this file already exists" |
| PR diff rewrites entire sections | Add: "Make minimal changes. Only modify lines that are factually incorrect." |
| Cron fires at unexpected times | Remind: cron is UTC. `0 9 * * *` = 9am UTC, which may be afternoon/evening locally |

---

## How to Verify It's Working

1. Introduce deliberate doc drift — change a function name in code but leave the doc unchanged
2. Trigger the workflow manually (`workflow_dispatch`)
3. Confirm a PR opens referencing the specific drifted line
4. Check the PR diff is focused (not a full rewrite)
5. Merge the PR — confirm the workflow doesn't propose the same change again next run

## Coaching Notes

The 96% merge rate comes from PR focus. Participants often produce one big PR that rewrites everything. Redirect: _"Would you review and merge a 200-file PR? How small does a PR need to be to get merged in 60 seconds?"_

The "if nothing found, do nothing" instruction is important — without it, the agent may open empty PRs or cosmetic changes just to have output. Ask participants: _"What happens if the agent runs every day but there's nothing to fix?"_
