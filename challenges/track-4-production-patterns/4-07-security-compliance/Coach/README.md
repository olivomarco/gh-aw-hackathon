# Coach Guide: Challenge 4-07 — Security Compliance

---

## What This Challenge Teaches

Policy-as-code: encoding security SLAs and vulnerability response procedures directly into a workflow. Participants learn to turn a compliance spreadsheet into an automated agent that tracks deadlines, classifies by severity, and escalates before anything slips. The key insight is that "security-as-code" is not just scanning — it's the full loop: detect, classify, track, alert.

# Security Compliance

Review open Dependabot alerts and security advisories for this repository.

SLA policy:
- Critical: must be remediated within 3 days of disclosure
- High: 14 days
- Medium: 30 days
- Low: 90 days

For each alert:
1. Determine severity and the date it was disclosed/opened
2. Calculate days remaining until SLA breach
3. If days remaining <= 2 (for critical) or <= 5 (for others): open an issue

Issue format:
- Title: "⚠️ SLA Approaching: [CVE-ID] — [package] ([severity])"
- Body: CVE ID, package name, severity, disclosure date, SLA deadline, days remaining, link to advisory
- Label: `security`, `sla-warning`

Do not open duplicate issues for the same CVE. If an open issue already exists for this CVE, skip it.
```

## Common Blockers

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| No Dependabot alerts to find | Have participant add a known vulnerable dep, or mock alerts in the prompt body |
| "security-events: read" permission denied | Ensure the repo has Dependabot alerts enabled (Settings > Security) |
| Duplicate issues opened every day | Add explicit dedup instruction: "If open issue exists for this CVE, skip" |
| Severity mapping is wrong | Clarify in body: "Severity levels match GitHub's: critical, high, medium, low" |
| Agent can't find `toolsets: [security]` | Confirm `gh aw` version supports security toolset — fallback to describing alerts in the prompt body |

---

## How to Verify It's Working

1. Add `lodash@4.17.4` (known CVE) or similar to `package.json` — push and wait for Dependabot to detect it
2. Trigger `workflow_dispatch`
3. Confirm an issue opens with CVE ID, severity, and days-remaining calculation
4. Trigger again — confirm no duplicate issue opens
5. Close the issue manually — confirm next run re-opens it if the advisory is unresolved

## Coaching Notes

The deeper lesson is policy codification. Ask: _"Where does your team's vulnerability SLA policy currently live?"_ Usually it's in a Notion doc, a spreadsheet, or someone's head. This workflow makes it executable and auditable.

Participants sometimes want to skip the issue and go straight to auto-PRs that bump the dependency. Redirect: the issue-creation-first pattern is intentional — Dependabot already handles auto-bumping, but SLA tracking and escalation are the gap this workflow fills.

Fast squads: extend the severity routing. Critical issues get `@security-team` mentioned in the body; low severity gets a comment on an existing issue rather than a new one.
