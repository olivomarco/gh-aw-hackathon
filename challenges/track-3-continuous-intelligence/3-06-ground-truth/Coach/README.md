# Coach Guide: Challenge 3-06 — Ground Truth

---

## Coaching Philosophy

This challenge teaches one of the most important production patterns in gh-aw: **grounding AI output in real data**. Squads at this level have seen agents produce confident-sounding but fabricated numbers. `pre-agent-steps:` is the solution: deterministic shell runs first, writes real values to files, and the agent reads those files.

**Key insight to surface:** The AI model is not a database. It cannot look up your open issue count — it will guess. `pre-agent-steps:` separates "gather facts" (shell, deterministic, reliable) from "reason about facts" (AI, creative, unreliable without grounding). That separation is the architecture of trustworthy automation.

**For `create-pr`:** The PR gate is about trust. Even when agents produce correct output, good teams don't merge automatically. `create-pr` is the "propose, don't impose" pattern — the agent does the work, a human approves the result.

---

## What `pre-agent-steps:` Does at Runtime

At execution time, gh-aw runs `pre-agent-steps:` as bash steps in the same runner environment as a standard GitHub Actions workflow. This happens **before** the AI model is invoked. Key facts:

1. All `${{ github.* }}` expressions are resolved (e.g., `${{ github.repository }}` → `owner/repo`)
2. The `gh` CLI is available and pre-authenticated with `GITHUB_TOKEN`
3. Files written to `/tmp/` are available to the agent during its run
4. **`/tmp/` files are ephemeral** — they exist only for this run and are not committed anywhere
5. If a `pre-agent-steps:` command fails (non-zero exit), the workflow aborts before the agent runs

The agent accesses these files by reading from the filesystem in its execution context. Point squads at this in their body: "Read `/tmp/open-issues.txt` for the count."

---

## Expected Outcomes

A finished solution has:

**File structure:**
- `.github/workflows/3-06-ground-truth.md` — ~40–55 lines
- `.github/workflows/3-06-ground-truth.lock.yml` — auto-generated

**Frontmatter shape:**
```yaml
---
on:
  workflow_dispatch: {}

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

pre-agent-steps:
  - name: Fetch repo health metrics
    run: |
      gh api "/repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues?state=open&per_page=100" \
        --jq 'length' > /tmp/open-issues.txt
      gh pr list --state open --json number --jq 'length' > /tmp/open-prs.txt
      git log -1 --format="%ci" > /tmp/last-commit.txt

safe-outputs:
  create-pr:
    base-branch: main
    title-template: "docs: update CONTRIBUTING.md with current project health"

engines:
  - copilot
---
```

**Behavior:**
- `pre-agent-steps:` runs 3 `gh`/`git` commands, writes results to `/tmp/`
- Agent reads those files and uses the numbers to update `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- A PR is opened with the changes — no direct commit

---

## How `create-pr` Differs from Direct Commits

Without `create-pr`, if an agent modifies a file, those changes are committed directly to the default branch. With `create-pr`:

1. The agent's file changes are staged on a new branch
2. A pull request is opened against `base-branch`
3. No changes land on `main` until a human (or automation) merges the PR

This is the "propose, don't impose" pattern. It's not just about safety — it's about auditability. Stakeholders can see exactly what the agent changed, in the diff, before it affects anything.

**The contrast:** `safe-outputs: noop` (read-only) → `safe-outputs: create-pr` (write, but gated) → direct commit (write, ungated — not available as a safe-output by design).

---

## Common Blockers

### Blocker 1: Missing `pull-requests: write` permission

**Symptom:** Workflow runs, `pre-agent-steps:` succeeds, agent runs, but no PR appears. Permission error in logs.

**Cause:** Only `contents: write` was declared. `create-pr` needs both.

**Fix:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
```

**Socratic response:** "Let's look at your permissions block. `create-pr` needs two permissions — which one is missing?"

---

### Blocker 2: `/tmp/` files are empty or missing

**Symptom:** Agent runs but uses wrong/fabricated numbers; dry-run shows empty files.

**Cause:** `gh api` command failed silently, or `jq` filter produced no output.

**Fix:** Add a validation step:
```yaml
pre-agent-steps:
  - name: Fetch repo health metrics
    run: |
      gh api "/repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues?state=open&per_page=100" \
        --jq 'length' > /tmp/open-issues.txt
      cat /tmp/open-issues.txt   # debug: show value in logs
```

**Socratic response:** "Run `gh aw run --dry-run` and check whether the `/tmp/` files have values. What does `cat /tmp/open-issues.txt` output in the dry-run logs?"

---

### Blocker 3: Agent doesn't use the real numbers

**Symptom:** PR opens but `CONTRIBUTING.md` contains made-up numbers or placeholder text.

**Cause:** The body doesn't explicitly tell the agent to read the `/tmp/` files. Agents will not discover them on their own.

**Fix:** Be explicit in the body:
```
Read /tmp/open-issues.txt — this file contains exactly one integer: the number of open issues.
Read /tmp/open-prs.txt — this file contains exactly one integer: the number of open pull requests.
Use these exact values. Do not estimate or fabricate.
```

**Socratic response:** "Does your body tell the agent where to find the data? Show me the line where you reference the `/tmp/` files."

---

### Blocker 4: PR opens against wrong branch

**Symptom:** PR is opened but targets a branch that doesn't exist or isn't the default.

**Cause:** `base-branch: main` but the repo's default branch is `master` or something else.

**Fix:** Check `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'` and use that value.

---

### Blocker 5: `${{ github.repository }}` not resolving

**Symptom:** `gh api` call fails with a URL that contains the literal string `${{ github.repository }}`.

**Cause:** Expression was placed outside a `run:` step, or inside a string that was not interpreted as a GitHub Actions expression.

**Fix:** `${{ github.repository }}` is valid inside `run:` in `pre-agent-steps:`. Confirm the expression is inside the `run:` block, not in a YAML comment or a string value assigned elsewhere.

---

## Solution Shape

Don't give the full workflow; describe what correct looks like.

A correct `3-06-ground-truth.md`:
- `pre-agent-steps:` with 3 named steps: one `gh api` for issues, one `gh pr list` for PRs, one `git log` for last commit
- Each writes a single value to a `/tmp/` file
- Body explicitly references each `/tmp/` file path and instructs the agent to use those exact values
- Body asks agent to update only the `## Project Health` section of `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `safe-outputs: create-pr: base-branch: main` with a descriptive `title-template`
- Both `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` in `permissions:`

---

## How to Verify It's Working

1. **Compile:** `gh aw compile .github/workflows/3-06-ground-truth.md` — no errors
2. **Dry-run:** `gh aw run --dry-run` — `pre-agent-steps:` output should show real numbers in `/tmp/` files
3. **Live run:** Trigger via `workflow_dispatch`
4. **PR check:** A PR should appear with a new branch; diff shows only `## Project Health` section changed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
5. **Number accuracy:** Open the PR, check the numbers in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Cross-check against `gh issue list --state open | wc -l` — numbers should match (within a few seconds of drift)

---

## Time Management

| Phase | Time | What to Do |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Read & orient | 3 min | Understand pre-agent-steps flow |
| Write pre-agent-steps | 8 min | 3 fetch commands + write to /tmp/ |
| Write agent body | 7 min | Reference /tmp/ files, describe CONTRIBUTING.md update |
| Configure create-pr | 3 min | base-branch, title-template, permissions |
| Compile + dry-run | 5 min | Verify /tmp/ files populated in dry-run output |
| Live test | 4 min | Trigger, verify PR opens with real numbers |

**Total: ~30 minutes.**

---

## Extension Ideas (Fast Squads)

1. **More metrics:** Add contributors count (`gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contributors --jq 'length'`), stars, or last release tag
2. **Conditional PR:** Only open a PR if the health metrics have changed since last week (compare against current `CONTRIBUTING.md` content)
3. **Scheduled run:** Change from `workflow_dispatch` to a weekly schedule
4. **Health trend:** Write metrics to `repo-memory` and have a separate workflow chart trends over time (combines 3-01 The Relay with this pattern)

---

## Key Takeaways for Coaches

- **Separation of concerns.** `pre-agent-steps:` = deterministic. Agent body = reasoning. This is good software architecture applied to AI workflows.
- **AI doesn't know your repo state.** This is not a flaw — it's by design. The agent's job is reasoning, not data fetching. `pre-agent-steps:` handles the fetch.
- **`create-pr` as a trust dial.** Squads may want to auto-merge. Push back gently: "When would you *not* want to auto-merge? Now build for that case." Most squads arrive at "keep the human in the loop for docs changes."
