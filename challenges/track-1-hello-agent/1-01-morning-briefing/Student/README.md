# Challenge 1-01: Morning Briefing

**Track:** Track 1 — Hello, Agent  
**Difficulty:** 🟢 Beginner  
**Estimated time:** 30 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** [Challenge 00 — Setup & Hello, Agent](../../00-setup/Student/README.md)

---

## What You'll Build

A scheduled workflow that runs every weekday morning at 9 AM and creates a GitHub issue summarizing your repo's activity from the past 24 hours. The agent will read recent issues and PRs, generate a natural-language digest, and post it to your repo as an issue titled "📋 Morning Briefing".

**Why this matters:** This is the first step toward real DevOps automation — scheduled reports that keep teams aligned without requiring manual check-ins. In production, morning briefings can surface blockers before standups, making async communication faster and more effective.

---

## Goals

By the end of this challenge, your squad will:

1. ✅ Write a gh-aw workflow triggered by `on: schedule` (cron syntax)
2. ✅ Use the GitHub MCP tool to query recent issues and PRs
3. ✅ Instruct the AI agent to summarize activity in natural language
4. ✅ Create an issue with structured, dated content using `safe-outputs: create-issue`
5. ✅ Understand the time-based trigger pattern for automation

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Workflow file `.github/workflows/morning-briefing.md` exists with valid frontmatter
- [ ] Frontmatter includes `on: schedule:` with a cron expression (e.g., `"0 9 * * 1-5"` for weekdays at 9 AM)
- [ ] Workflow uses `tools: github: toolsets: [issues, pull_requests]` to access repo data
- [ ] Safe-outputs includes `create-issue:` with a title prefix like `[Morning Briefing]`
- [ ] Permissions are scoped to `contents: read` (no write access)
- [ ] `.github/workflows/morning-briefing.lock.yml` is generated after compiling
- [ ] At least one issue was created when the workflow ran (or manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`)
- [ ] Issue body includes a summary of recent activity (issues opened, PRs, etc.)

---

## Tips & Hints

- **Cron syntax:** `0 9 * * 1-5` means 9 AM, Monday–Friday. (Explore `crontab.guru` if you need a cheat sheet.)
- **Permissions:** The GitHub tool needs `read` access to query issues and PRs, but `safe-outputs` handles the write to create the issue.
- **Natural language instructions:** Write something like: "Summarize the last 24 hours of activity in this repo. Include counts of opened/closed issues, opened/closed PRs, and highlight any high-priority items."
- **Workflow dispatch:** Add `workflow_dispatch:` to `on:` so you can test manually from the Actions tab without waiting for the cron schedule.
- **Tool queries:** The GitHub tool returns metadata (issue number, title, state, creation date). Your instructions should tell the agent how to present that to humans.

## Stuck?

If you're blocked for more than **15 minutes**:

1. **Check cron syntax:** Verify your cron expression on crontab.guru — an off-by-one error in the day-of-week is common.
2. **Test with workflow_dispatch:** Don't wait for the schedule; manually trigger from the Actions tab to see errors immediately.
3. **Read the agent logs:** Click your workflow run in the Actions tab and scroll to see what the AI agent actually tried to do.
4. **Simplify instructions:** If the agent isn't summarizing correctly, give it simpler guidance like "List all issues opened in the last 24 hours" before moving to complex summaries.

Ask your coach! They're here to help you unblock.

Good luck! 🚀
