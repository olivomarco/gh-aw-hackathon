# Challenge 3-01: The Relay

**Track:** Continuous Intelligence (Advanced)  
**Difficulty:** 🔴 Advanced  
**Estimated time:** 30 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Track 2, completed ≥3 challenges

---

## Background

Most workflows live in isolation—they trigger, they run, they're done. But what if your workflows could pass data to each other? What if one workflow's output became another's input?

**The Relay** is about **workflow chaining**. You'll build two workflows that work together: a **producer** (collects data, writes to `repo-memory`) and a **consumer** (reads that data, takes action). Think of it like a relay race where one agent hands off a baton to the next.

This pattern is the foundation for coordinated multi-workflow systems. When you build big automation, you're not writing one massive agent—you're orchestrating a team of specialists, each doing one thing well.

**Why this matters:** Workflow chaining unlocks producer-consumer patterns, state persistence across runs, and the ability to decompose complex logic into reusable pieces. You'll see this everywhere in advanced automation.

---

## Goals

By the end of this challenge, your squad will:

1. ✅ Build a **producer workflow** that writes structured data to `repo-memory`
2. ✅ Build a **consumer workflow** that reads from `repo-memory` and takes action
3. ✅ Understand the `tools: repo-memory` configuration and its `file-glob` patterns
4. ✅ See how workflows can communicate without direct coupling

---

## Challenge

Build two workflows that work together:

### Producer Workflow: `daily-metrics-collector.md`

Triggers **daily** and collects issue metrics:
- Current open issue count
- Average time-to-close for recently closed issues (last 7 days)
- Distribution of labels (top 5)

Write this data as a JSON snapshot to `repo-memory` with a timestamped filename (e.g., `repo-memory/metrics/2026-05-28.json`).

Use `safe-outputs: noop` (this is a data-collection workflow—no user-facing output, just persistence).

**Success:** File appears in `repo-memory/` branch with correct JSON structure.

### Consumer Workflow: `weekly-metrics-report.md`

Triggers **weekly** (or manually via `workflow_dispatch`) and:
1. Reads the last 7 JSON snapshots from `repo-memory/metrics/`
2. Analyzes the trend (is issue volume trending up or down?)
3. Creates a **discussion** with a summary: "This week, we closed {X} issues. Average time-to-close is {Y} days, trending {direction}."

Use `safe-outputs: create-discussion`.

**Success:** Discussion appears with the trend analysis.

## Success Criteria

**Producer Workflow:**
- [ ] Daily trigger works (`on: schedule:`)
- [ ] JSON file written to `repo-memory/metrics/{date}.json` with correct structure
- [ ] Workflow runs without errors (check Actions logs)
- [ ] `safe-outputs: noop` is called

**Consumer Workflow:**
- [ ] Weekly trigger works
- [ ] Reads from `repo-memory` using `file-glob: metrics/**/*.json`
- [ ] Discussion created with trend analysis
- [ ] Workflow correctly interprets the JSON from the producer

**Together:**
- [ ] Producer runs, data appears in `repo-memory/`
- [ ] Consumer reads that data and creates a discussion referencing the metrics
- [ ] The two workflows are not directly coupled (consumer doesn't know producer's name)

---

## Tips & Hints

- `repo-memory` is a branch in your repo (`repo-memory`). You can browse it on GitHub to verify files were written.
- The `file-glob` filter in the `tools: repo-memory:` block **silently drops** files that don't match—always double-check your glob pattern.
- For the producer: use simple `gh api` calls or the GitHub MCP tool to fetch issue counts. You don't need to parse the entire repo.
- For the consumer: the agent reads JSON and should summarize the trend in plain language. Don't overthink the analysis—"up", "down", or "stable" is enough.
- Use `expires:` on the discussion to auto-close old reports (keeps the page clean).
- The simplest producer outputs a 5-10 line JSON file. The consumer reads 7 of them and compares. That's it.

## Help

Stuck? Here's how to escalate:

- **"repo-memory branch not showing up?"** → Check the workflow logs. If `noop` or the safe-output succeeded, the branch should exist. Refresh the GitHub repo page.
- **"JSON file has the wrong structure?"** → Print the JSON in the workflow logs (use `echo` before writing) so you can see what the agent generated.
- **"Consumer can't read the files?"** → Verify the `file-glob` pattern matches. Run `echo metrics/**/*.json` to test the glob locally.
- **"I'm not sure how to compute the trend?"** → Read the last N files, compare the first value to the last value. If latest > first, it's "up". Simple as that.
