# Challenge 3-06: Ground Truth

**Track:** Continuous Intelligence (Advanced 🔴)  
**Estimated time:** 30 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Challenge 00, full Track 2, Challenges 3-01 and 3-02

## What You'll Build

A workflow that runs deterministic shell commands *before* the AI model starts — using `pre-agent-steps:` — to fetch real, live repo metrics via the `gh` CLI. The agent is given those numbers and uses them to update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with a "## Project Health" section. Instead of committing directly, it opens a pull request via the `create-pr` safe-output, keeping a human in the loop.

**Why this matters:** AI models hallucinate numbers. If you ask "how many open issues does this repo have?" without giving the model real data, it will guess. `pre-agent-steps:` closes that gap: shell commands run first, write real data to files, and the agent reads those files before reasoning. The result is grounded, accurate output — not plausible fiction.

---

## Goals

By the end of this challenge, your squad will:

1. ✅ Use `pre-agent-steps:` to fetch real repo metrics via `gh` CLI
2. ✅ Pass those metrics to the agent via files
3. ✅ Have the agent update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with live data
4. ✅ Open a PR (not a direct commit) using `create-pr`
5. ✅ Compile and dry-run successfully

---

## Background: `pre-agent-steps:`

`pre-agent-steps:` is a list of named shell steps that run before the AI model is invoked. They behave like GitHub Actions `run:` steps — you get full access to `gh`, `jq`, environment variables, and `${{ github.* }}` expressions.

```yaml
pre-agent-steps:
  - name: Fetch repo health metrics
    run: |
      gh api "/repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues?state=open&per_page=100" \
        --jq 'length' > /tmp/open-issues.txt
      gh pr list --state open --json number --jq 'length' > /tmp/open-prs.txt
      git log -1 --format="%ci" > /tmp/last-commit.txt
```

The files written to `/tmp/` are ephemeral — they exist only for the duration of this workflow run. The agent can read them directly by path.

**Key point:** These steps run as deterministic shell — no AI involved. The AI model is only called after `pre-agent-steps:` completes.

---

## Background: `create-pr`

The `create-pr` safe-output tells the gh-aw runtime to open a pull request containing any files the agent modified during its run. The agent does not commit directly; changes are staged and a PR is opened for human review.

```yaml
safe-outputs:
  create-pr:
    base-branch: main
    title-template: "docs: update CONTRIBUTING.md with current project health"
```

The `title-template` sets the PR title. The agent can suggest additional context in the PR body.

---

## Challenge

### Step 1: Write the `pre-agent-steps:`

Fetch at least 3 real data points before the agent runs:

- **Open issue count:** Use `gh api` with a `--jq 'length'` filter
- **Open PR count:** Use `gh pr list --state open --json number --jq 'length'`
- **Last commit date:** Use `git log -1 --format="%ci"`

Write each value to a `/tmp/` file.

### Step 2: Write the agent body

In the workflow body, instruct the agent to:

1. Read the `/tmp/` files to get the real numbers
2. Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` by adding (or replacing) a `## Project Health` section with those numbers
3. Keep the rest of `CONTRIBUTING.md` intact

Tell the agent explicitly where to find the data:

```
Read /tmp/open-issues.txt for the current open issue count.
Read /tmp/open-prs.txt for the number of open pull requests.
Read /tmp/last-commit.txt for the date of the last commit.
```

### Step 3: Configure `create-pr`

Add `create-pr` to `safe-outputs` with a `base-branch` of `main`. The agent's changes to `CONTRIBUTING.md` will land in a new branch, and a PR will be opened automatically.

### Step 4: Set permissions

`create-pr` requires both `contents: write` (to push a branch) and `pull-requests: write` (to open the PR). Both must be declared.

### Step 5: Compile and dry-run

```bash
gh aw compile .github/workflows/3-06-ground-truth.md
gh aw run --dry-run .github/workflows/3-06-ground-truth.md
```

The dry-run will execute `pre-agent-steps:` and show you the values captured — a quick sanity check before running for real.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `.github/workflows/3-06-ground-truth.md` compiles without errors
- [ ] `pre-agent-steps:` fetches at least 3 real metrics and writes them to `/tmp/`
- [ ] Agent body references those `/tmp/` files explicitly
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` is updated with a `## Project Health` section containing real numbers
- [ ] A PR is opened — not a direct commit
- [ ] PR title matches `title-template`
- [ ] Numbers in the PR are accurate (match what `gh` CLI would return for the repo)
- [ ] `permissions: contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` are both declared

---

## Gotchas

- **`${{ github.repository }}`** — this expression works inside `run:` steps in `pre-agent-steps:`. It resolves to `owner/repo` at runtime.
- **`/tmp/` files are ephemeral** — they are created fresh each run and are not committed. The agent reads them during its session; they do not persist after the run.
- **Missing `CONTRIBUTING.md`** — if the file doesn't exist, the agent will create it. That's fine — just note the PR will contain a new file, not a patch.
- **PR target branch** — `base-branch: main` assumes your default branch is `main`. Change to `master` or your actual default if needed.
- **Permissions scope** — `contents: write` alone is not enough; you also need `pull-requests: write` for the PR to open.

---

## Tips & Hints

- **Test `pre-agent-steps:` first.** Add a step that `cat`s the `/tmp/` files and check the dry-run output. If the files are empty or missing, fix the fetch commands before involving the AI.
- **Be explicit in the body.** Agents do better when you say "The file `/tmp/open-issues.txt` contains exactly one number — the count of open issues" rather than leaving them to discover the file.
- **Keep the PR small.** Instruct the agent to only modify the `## Project Health` section, not rewrite the whole file. Smaller diffs are easier to review.
- **`workflow_dispatch:` for testing.** Add it alongside your primary trigger so you can run on demand during development.

## Stuck?

- **"`pre-agent-steps:` not running?"** → Check indentation. `pre-agent-steps:` is a top-level frontmatter key, same level as `on:` and `permissions:`.
- **"Agent is using the wrong numbers"** → Verify the `/tmp/` files contain what you expect. Add a `cat /tmp/open-issues.txt` step to `pre-agent-steps:` and check dry-run output.
- **"PR not opening — permission error"** → Ensure both `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` are in `permissions:`.
- **"Agent modified the wrong part of CONTRIBUTING.md"** → Be more explicit in the body: "Only add or replace the section that begins with `## Project Health`. Do not modify any other section."

Ask your coach.
